# AI Social Media Analyzer & IoT Integration  
<a href="https://github.com/your-username/repository-name">

## **Inspiration**  
The idea for this project came from observing how social media drives real-world actions, from trending topics influencing public opinion to viral movements sparking physical responses. I wanted to bridge this digital impact with IoT, allowing real-world devices to react dynamically to online sentiment.  

## **What I Learned**  
Through this project, I gained hands-on experience in:  
- **AI & NLP** – Implementing sentiment analysis and topic modeling.  
- **APIs & Data Fetching** – Using Twitter and Instagram APIs for real-time data.  
- **IoT Integration** – Connecting AI decisions to physical devices using Raspberry Pi and ESP8266.  
- **Cloud Computing** – Hosting AI models and managing API requests efficiently.  

## **How I Built It**  
1. **Data Collection** – Used social media APIs to fetch live posts.  
2. **Sentiment Analysis** – Applied machine learning (NLTK, TensorFlow) to classify sentiment.  
3. **Trigger Mechanism** – Developed logic to activate IoT devices when a sentiment threshold was met.  
4. **IoT Actions** – Connected a smart light and fan via MQTT to respond dynamically.  

## **Challenges Faced**  
- **API Limitations** – Rate limits on social media APIs required optimization.  
- **Real-Time Processing** – Ensuring low latency for AI decisions.  
- **IoT Latency** – Synchronizing AI predictions with IoT triggers smoothly.
